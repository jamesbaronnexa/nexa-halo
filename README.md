# Nexa Halo - Week 1 Prototype

Building an AI companion that feels ALIVE.

## Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Goal for Week 1

Get the avatar to feel real with pre-recorded audio.
If it doesn't feel alive, no amount of AI will save it.

## Roadmap

- Day 1-2: Avatar loads and breathes ✓
- Day 3-4: Lip sync with audio
- Day 5-7: Polish until it feels REAL

## Testing

Show someone and ask "does this feel alive?"
- If YES → add AI next week
- If NO → keep polishing
